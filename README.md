# entropy-across-black-hole

Alice and Bob shared a Bell state initially, then Alice free fell into a Schwarzchild black hole, Bob hoved over the event
horizon. We can assume Bob is in a Rindler space, which is a reference frame with constant acceleration. Since Bob only has
access to half of the universe, the Von Neumann entropy of his qubit is smaller than Alice's qubit.

In this code I plotted the Von Neumann entropy observed by Bob vs temperature in the event horizon. As the temperature goes up, 
the entanglement entropy goes down, from 0.693 to 0.562.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. :)
