Generalized entropic uncertainty relation near a Schwarzschild black hole

Alice and Bob shared a maximum entangled state(Bell state) initially, then Alice free fell into a Schwarzchild black hole, Bob hoved over near the event horizon. We can assume Bob is in a Rindler space(R0=[1,1.05]), which is a reference frame with constant acceleration. Since Bob only has access to half of the universe, the other half of the universe is traced out, so the Von Neumann entropy of his qubit is smaller than Alice's qubit.

Furthermore, we can apply generalized entropy uncertainty relation to witness firewall, since it cause the entanglement entropy between Alice and Bob decrease.
